and for the node_modules, download this file -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jxa0pBruA4B7KLEuTwjrEhNC-WeoSNV6?usp=sharing
After you're done downloading the files. Make a folder with the name of the bot let's say 'Imperial Guard' and then paste all the files you downloaded into it.
Open VSCode and in the terminal, type 'node.' to run the bot.
The prefix of the bot is '>' so you can do, >ban @user 
The slash commands word too!
Enjoy! :D
